Deprecation notice
==================

Note that I don't work actively on this project anymore. The JS templating scene has evolved a lot since I started Databinder, and virtual DOM / incremental DOM are now the way to go. Try [Vue.js](http://vuejs.org/) or [Riot](http://riotjs.com/), these are both excellent libraries that fulfill the same role that DataBinder, better.
